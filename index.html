                <p>Stepping into the heart of San Francisco’s Mission District, one can not help but notice the murals lining the streets. Some sun-faded and battered by years of weather, 
                    others still vibrant and exploding with colors, the murals extend above storefronts, down alleys and across the garage doors of homes. What they all have in common are the stories they tell of culture, pain and resistance in the local community.</p>

                <p>Public-facing arts — murals, mosaics and other works on the streets and buildings of San Francisco — have long served as a canvas for political expression, beginning in the 1970s 
                    with immigrant communities protesting U.S. involvement in Central America by painting community murals in the Mission District. Today, public-facing arts continue to address injustice, with many artists calling attention to the genocide in Gaza. From the Mission District’s earliest 
                    murals to today’s urgent cries for justice, public-facing art is a compelling tool used to fight back against injustice. 
                </p>
                <p>One of the hallmark institutions of public-facing arts of San Francisco is Precita Eyes Muralists, a community-based, inner-city mural arts organization dedicated 
                    to mural creation, preservation and education. Founded in 1977, Precita Eyes offers walking tours through some of the most famous murals in the Mission.

                <p>“We are doing the very most that we possibly can, and it is still the least that we can do,” said Dottie Lux, an activist and artist who recently curated a multi-sensory exhibit transforming art into essential funds for families in Gaza.

                <p>Another artist, Palestinian-American Chris Gazaleh, has been creating art that raises awareness about the history, people and struggle for freedom in Palestine for years, beginning with graffiti letters in his youth and later moving to mural arts at 21 years old. His practice has earned him a wall in Clarion Alley, which has been his practice since 2012.

                    <p>San Francisco, a city known for its convergence of outspoken political activism and vibrant arts, continues to push the boundaries of the conventional through its public-facing arts. Yet, the tension between artistic expression and political protest remains a thin line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the murals of the Mission District are public-facing, those with political motivations are privately owned. As per the San Francisco Arts Commission, publicly-funded art, which is often publicly available, cannot be political.

                    <p>
                        “San Francisco is not tearing down anti-Zionist work or anything like that, but they’re going in the back door…to promote art that is more digestible,” Lux said
